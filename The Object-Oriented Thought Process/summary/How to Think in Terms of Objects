## summary
- How to Think in Terms of Objects
  - The Point
    - everything is object
    - interface: it is best to provide only the services that end users need. it's better not to change interface when changed implementaion. end users are object too.
    - implementaion: invisible to end users. 
    - abstract interface is reusable
    - minimal interface is good
  - memo
    - who is user? in the idea of object-oriented, user is not only customers but also that is all about using the interface
