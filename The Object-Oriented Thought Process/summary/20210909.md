## summary
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts
  - The Point
    - encapsulation: hide values or state or methods
    - inheritance: subclasses inherit from superclass
    - polymorphism: similar object should be able to use common interface
    - composition: object maked by multiple objects
  - memo
    - abstraction: objects or systems to focus attention on details of greater importance 

## TODO
- use [UML class diagram](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/uml-class-diagram-tutorial/) in work and study
